The effects of each outcome-based massage continue to be felt for days and even months after the 60-minute appointment, during which a trained therapist applies pressure according to the chiropractor\u2019s recommendations. Areas of chronic pain stand little chance against the therapist\u2019s sure-handed strokes, which may help release tense muscles, improve joint function, and prevent vestigial tails from drooping in an unseemly fashion.</p>","options":[{"isSoldOut":false,"expiresInDays":180,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/spinal-decompression-usa-1-seattle/confirmation?pledge_id=8730796","status":"open","maximumPurchaseQuantity":1,"discountPercent":92,"soldQuantityMessage":"1","externalUrl":null,"value":{"formattedAmount":"$350.00","amount":35000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"minimumPurchaseQuantity":1,"discount":{"formattedAmount":"$321.00","amount":32100,"currencyCode":"USD"},"title":"One consultation with spinal decompression therapy and a 60-minute massage","initialQuantity":0,"redemptionLocations":[],"details":[{"description":"Limit 1 per person.

The process begins in the dentist\u2019s office at one of Clearly Comfortable Smiles seven locations, where, during an initial exam, the doctor snaps x-rays and takes impressions of the upper and lower teeth. In the Invisalign lab, technicians craft a set of up to 48 transparent aligners made to the patient\u2019s exact specifications. Patients wear the removable aligners for 6\u201318 months, changing the aligners every two weeks and only removing them while eating, brushing, or modeling a finely clenched jaw. Throughout the treatment, patients return to the dentist's office for routine checkups to ensure teeth continue to shift into their proper places.

It's the oldest town in Skagit County, originally thriving as a fishing village thanks to its location at the tip of the Swinomish Channel, a saltwater slough that connected local fishermen to the Puget Sound. Today, you're more likely to see recreational boaters sailing the channel;  the bright-orange Rainbow Bridge offers one of the best views.</p>\n\n<p>Following the Great Depression, La Conner became a haven for writers and artists who found inspiration in the picturesque scenery and quiet lifestyle. By 1970 the town was home to one of the most vibrant artists' communities in the Northwest. You can glimpse this legacy at the Museum of Northwest Art, where exhibits highlight work from the region's many contemporary artists including Walter Isaacs and Morris Graves.</p>\n\n<p>For a living history lesson, check out the 19th-century homes and wood false-front buildings that line the streets of downtown La Conner, which has more than 160 buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Among them, the restored Gaches Mansion houses the <a href=\"http://gr.pn/19AmegD\">La Conner Quilt &amp; Textile Museum</a>. It's one of the few such museums in the country and features three stories of locally made quilts that range from traditional to contemporary.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

The ferry system connects the largest San Juan Islands and shuttles walk-on passengers back and forth throughout the day at no cost. </p>\n\n<p>Back at the hotel, set in an expansive Victorian home since 1904, a classic English garden with fragrant flowers and arbors of wisteria surrounds an outdoor seating area. In warmer months, you'll find this space filled with guests and ferry passengers noshing on homemade pastries such as croissants, cinnamon rolls, danishes, and fresh-brewed espresso from the <a href=\"http://gr.pn/T3a0RP\">Hotel Caf\u00e9 and Bakery</a>. For a larger meal, head inside to <a href=\"http://gr.pn/WGlZvT\">Octavia's Bistro</a>, known for its northwestern cuisine prepared with a hint of Hawaiian and Asian flair. </p>\n\n<p>The guest rooms are individually decorated, but warm quilts and antique furnishings are common. In the Killebrew Lake room, which has a private bath and a jacuzzi tub, french doors open onto a sun deck. At the top of the house is the Blind Bay room, Ashley's personal favorite; its sloped walls evoke a castle tower. Some rooms feature TVs and private baths; consult the <a href=\"http://gr.pn/Tdonr3\">guest room</a> details to find a room that suits your needs. </p>\n\n<p>On Friday nights, the onsite pub hosts a live music night, where locals and guests mingle while listening to jazz and classic rock. The pub serves a variety of regional wines as well as the local Spy Hop gin, made in Friday Harbor.</p>\n\n<h4>Orcas Island: Rural San Juan Island Off the Northwest Coast of Washington</h4>\n\n<p>In the straits north of Seattle and south of Vancouver lies the San Juan Island chain, a hilly archipelago composed of close to 100 tiny islands. Orcas Island is the largest of them all at 57 square miles and is connected to the mainland by the Washington State Ferries system. At the heart of the island is the 5,000-acre Moran State Park and Mount Constitution, which showcases 360-degree views from Canada to Seattle. Hikers can traverse the 30 miles of lakes, trails, and waterfalls surrounding the mountain. Small hamlets dot the island; just a 15-minute drive from the hotel is East Sound, know for its artist studios and caf\u00e9s. </p>\n\n<p>Waits for ferry rides with a car can be long; consider leaving your car on the mainland and renting one at the agency just beside the hotel. Or hop aboard the 45-minute ferry ride to Friday Harbor, where there's an abundance of restaurants and shops that stock jewelry and handcrafts by local artists, all located right beside the ferry landing. On the water itself, the hotel can schedule whale-watching and sea-kayaking excursions, and back on land, will arrange spa and massage services.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

The timber industry is still big business in town, but there\u2019s also a lot of natural beauty\u2014state parks, botanical gardens, and miles of pristine shoreline. Guests of the Best Western Plus Evergreen Inn &amp; Suites have easy access to the sights, thanks to the hotel\u2019s complimentary shuttle. It operates from 6 a.m. to midnight, covering a 5-mile radius that includes the Seattle-Tacoma Airport. There\u2019s free parking at the hotel, too, so day trips to Seattle are a breeze.</p>\n\n<p>Inside, the hotel is a family- and business-friendly environment. Kids will enjoy the heated indoor pool, while those here for work will find everything they need in the business center. Ten different restaurants can be found within a half-mile of the hotel, and the onsite Seasons Restaurant serves breakfast and dinner. Start your day with a complimentary continental breakfast that includes a choice of cereal, eggs, bread, and fruit.</p>\n\n<h4>Federal Way, Washington: Coastal Town near Seattle\u2019s Coffee Shops and Galleries</h4>\n\n<p>Like the neighboring cities of Tacoma and Seattle, Federal Way is set right along Puget Sound. The coastal town is rich in natural beauty, especially at <a href=\"http://gr.pn/YkTJzo\">Dash Point State Park</a>, an expansive seaside camping area with more than 11 miles of hiking and biking trails. Don\u2019t miss the <a href=\"http://gr.pn/10nLO24\">Pacific Rim Bonsai Collection</a>, a tropical conservatory that\u2019s home to 60 bonsai trees from six Pacific Rim nations. </p>\n\n<p>A half-hour drive north brings to you to downtown Seattle. Here, street performers often play music as shoppers walk beneath the iconic Public Market Center sign at the open-air <a href=\"http://gr.pn/q9AudW\">Pike\u2019s Place Market</a>. One of Seattle\u2019s most renowned attractions, the marketplace bustles with vendors selling fresh fruit, vegetables, fish, flowers, and meat. Before the spread of Starbucks to every corner, Seattleites grabbed cups of java at the company's original coffeehouse, which first opened here in 1971. Head a few blocks north of the market to find even more gourmet coffee shops in the inviting neighborhood of Belltown, an arts district filled with caf\u00e9s, shops, and galleries.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?
